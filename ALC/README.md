# Abel Library Collection

This project is intended to be a collection of all libraries written by me.
It will either be built into a static ~~or a dynamic~~ library. 

Before inclusion, you may specify the following macro flags:
 - **ALC_UTEST_TXCOLORS**: Use TXLib to provide colored output in utest.h
