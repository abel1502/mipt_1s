Who's there?
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Long live the king!
Bernardo?
He.
You come most carefully upon your hour.
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
Have you had quiet guard?
Not a mouse stirring.
Well, good night.
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Friends to this ground.
And liegemen to the Dane.
Give you good night.
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Bernardo has my place.
Holla! Bernardo!
Say,
A piece of him.
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
I have seen nothing.
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Sit down awhile;
Well, sit we down,
Last night of all,
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
It would be spoke to.
Question it, Horatio.
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
It is offended.
See, it stalks away!
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Before my God, I might not this believe
Is it not like the king?
As thou art to thyself:
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
In what particular thought to work I know not;
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
That can I;
I think it be no other but e'en so:
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Do, if it will not stand.
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis gone!
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
And then it started like a guilty thing
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
In that and all things will we show our duty.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
My dread lord,
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
A little more than kin, and less than kind.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Ay, madam, it is common.
If it be,
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Hail to your lordship!
I am glad to see you well:
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
My good lord--
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
I would not hear your enemy say so,
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Where, my lord?
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
He was a man, take him for all in all,
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Saw? who?
My lord, the king your father.
The king my father!
Season your admiration for awhile
For God's love, let me hear.
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
But where was this?
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Did you not speak to it?
My lord, I did;
'Tis very strange.
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
We do, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Arm'd, my lord.
From top to toe?
My lord, from head to foot.
Then saw you not his face?
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
What, look'd he frowningly?
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Pale or red?
Nay, very pale.
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Most constantly.
I would I had been there.
It would have much amazed you.
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Longer, longer.
Not when I saw't.
His beard was grizzled--no?
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
I will watch to-night;
I warrant it will.
If it assume my noble father's person,
Our duty to your honour.
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Do you doubt that?
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
No more but so?
Think it no more;
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
O, fear me not.
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
Farewell.
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Marry, well bethought:
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
I shall obey, my lord.
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
It is a nipping and an eager air.
What hour now?
I think it lacks of twelve.
No, it is struck.
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Is it a custom?
Ay, marry, is't:
Look, my lord, it comes!
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
It beckons you to go away with it,
Look, with what courteous action
No, by no means.
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
Do not, my lord.
Why, what should be the fear?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
It waves me still.
You shall not go, my lord.
Hold off your hands.
Be ruled; you shall not go.
My fate cries out,
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Heaven will direct it.
Nay, let's follow him.
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Mark me.
I will.
My hour is almost come,
Alas, poor ghost!
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
Speak; I am bound to hear.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
What?
I am thy father's spirit,
O God!
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder!
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
I find thee apt;
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
My lord, my lord,--
Lord Hamlet,--
Heaven secure him!
So be it!
Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
How is't, my noble lord?
What news, my lord?
O, wonderful!
Good my lord, tell it.
No; you'll reveal it.
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Nor I, my lord.
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
Why, right; you are i' the right;
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
There's no offence, my lord.
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
What is't, my lord? we will.
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
My lord, we will not.
Nay, but swear't.
In faith,
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Upon my sword.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Swear.
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Propose the oath, my lord.
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear.
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Swear.
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
Swear.
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
I will, my lord.
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
My lord, I did intend it.
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Ay, very well, my lord.
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
As gaming, my lord.
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
My lord, that would dishonour him.
'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
But, my good lord,--
Wherefore should you do this?
Ay, my lord,
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
Very good, my lord.
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
My lord, I have.
God be wi' you; fare you well.
Good my lord!
Observe his inclination in yourself.
I shall, my lord.
And let him ply his music.
Well, my lord.
Farewell!
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
With what, i' the name of God?
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Mad for thy love?
My lord, I do not know;
What said he?
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
That hath made him mad.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
Both your majesties
But we both obey,
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
Heavens make our presence and our practises
Ay, amen!
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
I doubt it is no other but the main;
Well, we shall sift him.
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
It likes us well;
This business is well ended.
More matter, with less art.
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
But how hath she
What do you think of me?
As of a man faithful and honourable.
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
Do you think 'tis this?
It may be, very likely.
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
Not that I know.
How may we try it further?
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
So he does indeed.
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
We will try it.
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
Well, God-a-mercy.
Do you know me, my lord?
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
Not I, my lord.
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Honest, my lord!
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
That's very true, my lord.
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
I have, my lord.
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
How say you by that? Still harping on my
Words, words, words.
What is the matter, my lord?
Between who?
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
Though this be madness, yet there is method
Into my grave.
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
Fare you well, my lord.
These tedious old fools!
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
God save you, sir!
My honoured lord!
My most dear lord!
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
As the indifferent children of the earth.
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Neither, my lord.
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
'Faith, her privates we.
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Prison, my lord!
Denmark's a prison.
Then is the world one.
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
We think not so, my lord.
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
A dream itself is but a shadow.
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
We'll wait upon you.
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
What should we say, my lord?
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
To what end, my lord?
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
What say you?
Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
My lord, we were sent for.
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
No, indeed, are they not.
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
Is't possible?
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Do the boys carry it away?
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
There are the players.
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
In what, my dear lord?
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
Well be with you, gentlemen!
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
The actors are come hither, my lord.
Buz, buz!
Upon mine honour,--
Then came each actor on his ass,--
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
What a treasure had he, my lord?
Why,
Still on my daughter.
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
Nay, that follows not.
What follows, then, my lord?
Why,
What speech, my lord?
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
'Anon he finds him
This is too long.
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
'The mobled queen?'
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
Come, sirs.
Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Ay, my lord.
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
Ay, my lord.
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
Good my lord!
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
Did he receive you well?
Most like a gentleman.
But with much forcing of his disposition.
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Did you assay him?
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
'Tis most true:
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
We shall, my lord.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
I shall obey you.
Madam, I wish it may.
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
O, 'tis too true!
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
Good my lord,
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
No, not I;
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
Ha, ha! are you honest?
My lord?
Are you fair?
What means your lordship?
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
I was the more deceived.
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
At home, my lord.
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
O heavenly powers, restore him!
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
It shall be so:
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
I warrant your honour.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
And the queen too, and that presently.
Bid the players make haste.
We will, my lord.
What ho! Horatio!
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
O, my dear lord,--
Nay, do not think I flatter;
Well, my lord:
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
No, nor mine now.
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
What did you enact?
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
O, ho! do you mark that?
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
No, my lord.
I mean, my head upon your lap?
Ay, my lord.
Do you think I meant country matters?
I think nothing, my lord.
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
What is, my lord?
Nothing.
You are merry, my lord.
Who, I?
Ay, my lord.
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
What means this, my lord?
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
For us, and for our tragedy,
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
'Tis brief, my lord.
As woman's love.
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
So many journeys may the sun and moon
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
O, confound the rest!
Wormwood, wormwood.
The instances that second marriage move
I do believe you think what now you speak;
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
If she should break it now!
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
Sleep rock thy brain,
Madam, how like you this play?
The lady protests too much, methinks.
O, but she'll keep her word.
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
What do you call the play?
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
Still better, and worse.
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
The king rises.
What, frighted with false fire!
How fares my lord?
Give o'er the play.
Give me some light: away!
Lights, lights, lights!
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
Half a share.
A whole one, I.
You might have rhymed.
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
Very well, my lord.
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
I did very well note him.
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Sir, a whole history.
The king, sir,--
Ay, sir, what of him?
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
With drink, sir?
No, my lord, rather with choler.
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
You are welcome.
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
Sir, I cannot.
What, my lord?
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
My lord, you once did love me.
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
Sir, I lack advancement.
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
My lord, I cannot.
I pray you.
Believe me, I cannot.
I do beseech you.
I know no touch of it, my lord.
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
Methinks it is like a weasel.
It is backed like a weasel.
Or like a whale?
Very like a whale.
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
I will say so.
By and by is easily said.
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
We will ourselves provide:
The single and peculiar life is bound,
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
We will haste us.
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
Thanks, dear my lord.
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Mother, mother, mother!
I'll warrant you,
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Why, how now, Hamlet!
What's the matter now?
Have you forgot me?
No, by the rood, not so:
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
What, ho! help, help, help!
How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
O, I am slain!
O me, what hast thou done?
Nay, I know not:
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king!
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
Such an act
Ay me, what act,
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
O Hamlet, speak no more:
Nay, but to live
O, speak to me no more;
A murderer and a villain;
No more!
A king of shreds and patches,--
Alas, he's mad!
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Do not forget: this visitation
How is it with you, lady?
Alas, how is't with you,
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
To whom do you speak this?
Do you see nothing there?
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Nor did you nothing hear?
No, nothing but ourselves.
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
This the very coinage of your brain:
Ecstasy!
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
O, throw away the worser part of it,
What shall I do?
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
I must to England; you know that?
Alack,
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
Bestow this place on us a little while.
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
O heavy deed!
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O Gertrude, come away!
Safely stowed.
Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
Do not believe it.
Believe what?
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
I understand you not, my lord.
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
A thing, my lord!
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
But where is he?
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Bring him before us.
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
At supper.
At supper! where?
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
Alas, alas!
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
What dost you mean by this?
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
Where is Polonius?
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
Go seek him there.
He will stay till ye come.
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
For England!
Ay, Hamlet.
Good.
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
I will do't, my lord.
Go softly on.
Good sir, whose powers are these?
They are of Norway, sir.
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Against some part of Poland.
Who commands them, sir?
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
God be wi' you, sir.
Wilt please you go, my lord?
I'll be with you straight go a little before.
I will not speak with her.
She is importunate, indeed distract:
What would she have?
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Let her come in.
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
How now, Ophelia!
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
Nay, but, Ophelia,--
Pray you, mark.
Alas, look here, my lord.
How do you, pretty lady?
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
Conceit upon her father.
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
Pretty Ophelia!
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
How long hath she been thus?
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
Follow her close; give her good watch,
Alack, what noise is this?
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Save yourself, my lord:
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
The doors are broke.
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
No, let's come in.
I pray you, give me leave.
We will, we will.
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
Calmly, good Laertes.
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
What is the cause, Laertes,
Where is my father?
Dead.
But not by him.
Let him demand his fill.
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
Who shall stay you?
My will, not all the world:
Good Laertes,
None but his enemies.
Will you know them then?
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
Why, now you speak
Let her come in.
How now! what noise is that?
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
This nothing's more than matter.
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Do you see this, O God?
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Let this be so;
So you shall;
What are they that would speak with me?
Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
Let them come in.
God bless you, sir.
Let him bless thee too.
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
It well appears: but tell me
O, for two special reasons;
And so have I a noble father lost;
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
From Hamlet! who brought them?
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
Know you the hand?
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
If it be so, Laertes--
Ay, my lord;
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
My lord, I will be ruled;
It falls right.
What part is that, my lord?
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A Norman was't?
A Norman.
Upon my life, Lamond.
The very same.
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
He made confession of you,
What out of this, my lord?
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Why ask you this?
Not that I think you did not love your father;
To cut his throat i' the church.
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
I will do't:
Let's further think of this;
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
Drown'd! O, where?
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
Drown'd, drown'd.
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
Let's follow, Gertrude:
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her

It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here

Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.

Why, he had none.

Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
Mine, sir.
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
What man dost thou dig it for?
For no man, sir.
What woman, then?
For none, neither.
Who is to be buried in't?
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the

How strangely?
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
Upon what ground?

This?
E'en that.
Let me see.
What's that, my lord?
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
E'en so.
And smelt so? pah!
E'en so, my lord.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may

No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
What ceremony else?
That is Laertes,
What ceremony else?
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
Must there no more be done?
No more be done:
Lay her i' the earth:
What, the fair Ophelia!
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
O, treble woe
What is he whose grief
The devil take thy soul!
Thou pray'st not well.
Pluck them asunder.
Hamlet, Hamlet!
Gentlemen,--
Good my lord, be quiet.
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
O my son, what theme?
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
O, he is mad, Laertes.
For love of God, forbear him.
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
This is mere madness:
Hear you, sir;
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
Remember it, my lord?
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
That is most certain.
Up from my cabin,
Is't possible?
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
I beseech you.
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Ay, good my lord.
An earnest conjuration from the king,
How was this seal'd?
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
Why, what a king is this!
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
It must be shortly known to him from England
It will be short: the interim is mine;
Peace! who comes here?
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
No, my good lord.
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
I beseech you, remember--
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
Sir?
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
Of Laertes?
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
Of him, sir.
I know you are not ignorant--
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
What's his weapon?
Rapier and dagger.
That's two of his weapons: but, well.
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
What call you the carriages?
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
How if I answer 'no'?
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
I commend my duty to your lordship.
Yours, yours.
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
The king and queen and all are coming down.
In happy time.
The queen desires you to use some gentle
She well instructs me.
You will lose this wager, my lord.
I do not think so: since he went into France, I

It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of

Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
I am satisfied in nature,
I embrace it freely;
Come, one for me.
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
You mock me, sir.
No, by this hand.
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
Very well, my lord
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
This is too heavy, let me see another.
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Ay, my good lord.
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
Come on, sir.
Come, my lord.
One.
No.
Judgment.
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Well; again.
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
Our son shall win.
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Good madam!
Gertrude, do not drink.
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
I do not think't.
And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
Say you so? come on.
Nothing, neither way.
Have at you now!
Part them; they are incensed.
Nay, come, again.
Look to the queen there, ho!
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
How is't, Laertes?
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
How does the queen?
She swounds to see them bleed.
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
The point!--envenom'd too!
Treason! treason!
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
He is justly served;
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
Never believe it:
As thou'rt a man,
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
O, I die, Horatio;
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
Where is this sight?
What is it ye would see?
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
The sight is dismal;
Not from his mouth,
Let us haste to hear it,
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
Let four captains
